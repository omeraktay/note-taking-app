I am creating a Note-Taking App. 

<-- important -->
Run the app with 'https'

Endpoints:
https://localhost:3000 => Redirect to login page
https://localhost:3000/users/register => Register page
https://localhost:3000/users/login => Login page
https://localhost:3000/users/profile => Users' profile page
https://localhost:3000/notes/index => My notes / To manage CRUD operations for notes 

After you initialize npm you need to download the following dependencies: 
"bcrypt"
"bcryptjs"
"body-parser"
"connect-flash"
"cookie-parser"
"dotenv"
"ejs"
"express"
"express-ejs-layouts"
"express-openid-connect"
"express-session"
"fs"
"https"
"jsonwebtoken"
"mongoose"
"morgan"
"passport"
"passport-auth0"
"passport-local"
"serve-favicon"
